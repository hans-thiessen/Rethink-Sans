# My Font

Description of your font goes here. We recommend to start with a very short presentation line (the kind you would use on twitter to present your project for example), and then add as much details as necesary :-) Origin of the project, idea of usage, concept of creationâ€¦ but also number of masters, axes, character sets, etc.

Don't hesitate to create images!

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at https://hans-thiessen.github.io/Rethink-Sans-2.

## Changelog
