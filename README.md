# Rethink Sans

Rethink is one of the largest global independent creative agencies. Founded in Vancouver in 1999, it now has offices in New York, Toronto, Vancouver, and Montréal.

Rethink Sans was created in 2023 by Rethink’s ECD of Design Hans Thiessen, in collaboration with the fine folks at Google Fonts. It was developed specifically to help everyone design with greater confidence and craft in Google Workspace.

Deceptively simple, Rethink Sans is filled with thoughtfully turbocharged features, including: weight-specific tracking, two styles of circled numbers a simple keystroke away, and tabular lining figures right out-of-the-box.

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at https://hans-thiessen.github.io/Rethink-Sans-2.
